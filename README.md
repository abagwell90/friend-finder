Andrew J Bagwell friend finder app

Here is a link to live app: https://andrews-friend-finder.herokuapp.com/

What the project does?:

My app is a sompatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Here's how the app works?:

The app will take users to the landing page where they will be allowed to hit submit "go to survey" button. Then they can complete survey, where they have to submit all answers, including adding a photo link. There resoponsses are saved, and compared against other users and new submissions to find closest match. 

Why the project is useful?:

Teaches me JavaScript, Node.js, API Routing, Express and use of Heroku.

Who maintains and contributes to the project?:

Andrew J Bagwell.
